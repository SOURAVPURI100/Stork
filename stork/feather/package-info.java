/**
 * Classes and interfaces for implementing data transfer applications using the
 * Feather framework. Feather is a framework for enacting asynchronous
 * transactions on heterogeneous endpoint resources. In other words, data
 * transfer applications built using Feather provide a common interface through
 * which data resources on remote storage systems may be transferred and have
 * their metadata manipulated. The protocol-agnostic abstraction layer provided
 * by a Feather implementation yields a mechanism for streaming data to any
 * other Feather implementation regardless of the underlying transfer protocol,
 * allowing for proxied data transfer between heterogeneous data storage
 * endpoints.
